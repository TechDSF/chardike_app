              "Cosrx is one of the first product lines I tried when I got into Kbeauty brands a few years back. Their formula’s don’t irritate my sensitive skin or break the bank. I bought both this and the good morning PH balancing cleanser. Initially I loved the latter and found this to be very drying. Come to find out sometime later after switching from my summer routine into fall/ winter I realized I wasn’t giving my skin enough moisture the whole time and no cleanser was to blame. I love this now that I adjusted my routine to be more focused on moisture and barrier repair. My skin feels so smooth when I use this, especially helps with the blackheads in the nose area when followed by Paula’s choose BHA gel on top.",
